# When the installer first runs, it stores a copy of the relevant environment
# variables. To run other Docker commands, it's helpful to "source" them back,
# if found. Likewise, this file itself should be "sourced", not executed.

# The default is /crate/config/set_crate_docker_host_envvars (per HostPath in
# installer.py). We allow the user to pre-override this with environment
# variables.
