CRATE: Clinical Records Anonymisation and Text Extraction
=========================================================

Created by Rudolf Cardinal. Currently developed by Rudolf Cardinal and Martin
Burchell. See :ref:`contributors <contributors>`.

CRATE is an open-source software system that:

- anonymises or de-identifies arbitrary relational databases.
- maps patient identifiers to research identifiers (pseudonyms).
- connects relational databases to external tools for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- provides a web front end for research and administrative functions.
- supports a means by which patients may consent to be contacted about research.

.. note::

    To install CRATE, see :ref:`Installation <installation>`

.. note::

    If you're a clinician or a researcher using a CRATE web site to explore a
    research database, see the :ref:`Overview for clinicians and researchers
    <crateweb_clinician_researcher_overview>`.
