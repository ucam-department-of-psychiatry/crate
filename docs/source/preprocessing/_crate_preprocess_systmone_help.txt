Indexes a SystmOne database to be suitable for CRATE.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --url URL             SQLAlchemy database URL
  -v, --verbose         Verbose
  --print               Print SQL but do not execute it. (You can redirect the
                        printed output to create an SQL script.)
  --echo                Echo SQL
  --systmone_context {tpp_sre,cpft_dw}
                        Context of the SystmOne database that you are reading.
                        [tpp_sre: TPP Strategic Reporting Extract // cpft_dw:
                        CPFT Data Warehouse]
  --systmone_allow_unprefixed_tables
                        Permit tables that don't start with the expected
                        prefix (which is e.g. 'SR' for the TPP SRE context,
                        'S1_' for the CPFT Data Warehouse context). May add
                        helpful content, but you may get odd tables and views.
  --postcodedb POSTCODEDB
                        Specify database (schema) name for ONS Postcode
                        Database (as imported by CRATE) to link to addresses
                        as a view. With SQL Server, you will have to specify
                        the schema as well as the database; e.g. "--postcodedb
                        ONS_PD.dbo"
  --geogcols [GEOGCOLS [GEOGCOLS ...]]
                        List of geographical information columns to link in
                        from ONS Postcode Database. BEWARE that you do not
                        specify anything too identifying. Default: bua11
                        buasd11 casward imd lea lsoa01 lsoa11 msoa01 msoa11
                        nuts oac01 oac11 parish pcon pct ru11ind statsward
                        ur01ind
  --drop_danger_drop    REMOVES new columns and indexes, rather than creating
                        them. (There's not very much danger; no real
                        information is lost, but it might take a while to
                        recalculate it.)
