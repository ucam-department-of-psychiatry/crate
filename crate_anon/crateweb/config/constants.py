    Strings used as Django names for CRATE views; see
    :mod:`crate_anon.crateweb.config.urls`.

    We should use this lookup method throughout the Python code, e.g. for calls
    to :func:`reverse` and :func:`redirect`.

    We could also use them in the templates, rather than using hard-coded
    strings. We can do that via our common context,
    :func:`crate_anon.crateweb.core.context_processors.common_context`.
    However, the (runtime) failure message then becomes e.g.

    .. code-block:: none

        Reverse for '' not found. '' is not a valid view function or pattern
        name.

    rather than the more informative

    .. code-block:: none

        Reverse for 'ridlookup2' not found. 'ridlookup2' is not a valid view
        function or pattern name.

    ... so probably best not to (there is also no PyCharm checking of the
    Django context).
